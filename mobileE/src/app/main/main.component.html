                  <h2>Lameness Evaluation</h2>
                  <p>
                      Soundness is one of the most important if not
                      the most important aspects of horse ownership. Ensuring that a horse is comfortable
                      and pain free allows him to do his job to his fullest potential. If you notice
                      that your horse is limping or not bearing weight evenly on all 4 legs, an
                      evaluation by a veterinarian is warranted. During a lameness exam, the horse
                      will be evaluated in motion on a straight line and in a circle in both
                      directions. The horse will also be evaluated while standing. Once the affected
                      leg is identified, in depth palpation and flexing will be performed. At that
                      point, a systematic series of nerve blocks will be performed to isolate the
                      area of problem. During the nerve blocking procedure, nerves on the leg are
                      isolated and a small amount of lidocaine is placed over the nerve to numb the
                      area that it controls. Nerve blocks are started at the lowest point on the leg
                      move upwards as the exam progresses. Once the lameness is abolished with a
                      nerve block, the lameness has been isolated. After the area is pinpointed,
                      further diagnostics such as digital xray or ultrasound can be performed to
                      elucidate the cause of the lameness.

                  <h1>Dental Floating</h1>
                  <p>
                    A horse’s teeth continue to erupt throughout their lives and are ground down as they masticate. Routine floating is necessary to keep the grinding surface of the molars flat to allow the horse to properly break down fibrous food. If a horse is unable to chew properly and break down food, the small intestine will not be able to absorb a sufficient amount of nutrients. The upper jaw of the horse is wider than the lower jaw. This unequal width creates a natural wear pattern in which sharp points form on the outside (cheek side) of the upper molars and inside (tongue side) of the lower molars. These uneven sharp points can cause painful ulceration of the sensitive oral mucosa. Hooks can also occur on the first and last molars due to poor oral conformation and can cause pain if left untreated. Wolf teeth are small teeth that erupt right in front of the first molars on the upper jaw. They can interfere with the bit and are usually extracted when the horse is young.
                    <br>
                    Before your horse’s teeth are floated, a full physical exam will be done to assess general health and ensure that your horse is healthy enough for sedation. Then your horse will be very lightly sedated to ensure his comfort and safety during the procedure. A power float is used during the procedure to grind down any sharp enamel points or molar hooks that may be present. Using a power float as opposed to hand floats ensures precise treatment of each tooth without trauma to the surrounding sensitive oral tissue. It also takes less than half of the time compared to hand floating. This means less sedation, less stress, and less time that the mouth is open in the speculum.
                    <br>
                    Regular oral exams and yearly dental floating is important to the overall health of the horse. Poor dental care can result in balling or dropping of food out of the mouth, weight loss, poor hair coat, and behavioral issues. <span class="bold">Oral examinations are included FOR FREE each time Dr. Friedlander vaccinates your horse.</span>

            "Dr. Jackie is a fantastic vet. She has great inner sense of what a horse's problem is. Being a fantastic human being helps her have a great bedside manner with her patient's owners. Her husband Martin is a great asset to her. They make such a complementary team. She always returns calls and you can completely count on her. She’s a definitely a five star vet!" <br><span  style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 165%">- Carol Botnick Karl</span>

            "After being with the same Vet for 9 years moving to Agua Dulce was really scary. My horses are family to me. I actually trailered my hores to Apple Valley to my old vet for everything the first year I lived here. While I was at the paddock in Los Angeles one day I was told by a trainer that her Vet had moved to Agua Dulce and that she was amazing. I called Jackie and was so surprised to hear that she was a Mobile Vet. I immediately made an appt for her to meet my horses. What a small world! She lived 5 mins away! One of my horse’s has a weird Fly reaction each season, Jackie immediately made contact with my Vet in Apple Valley. And through him worked the exact plan out that we had been doing for years. I liked the ‘Hey, if aint broke – dont fix it’ attitude. She has helped me through 1 or 2 Emergencies as well. She is always avail by Phone, text, or email (I love her new age attitude). I love that even its its minor she says, ‘Well on my way to work I can stop by and see.’ Her work ethic is amazing. I dont feel like she is a Vet for the All Mighty Dollar. In fact she has saved me money. I would recommend her to everyone. She also turned my Coggins around faster than anyone ever has last summer. It has been great doing business with someone who lives in our area. And one more thing – I have never had a Vet this accessible and friendly. Imagine that! I work 24/7 for my clients. I like knowing someone is there for me 24/7…" <br>
